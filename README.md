## Microsoft Power Apps - Help Desk Application Project

**Help Desk project was developed by using provided Help Desk template by Microsoft.** 

*Sharepoint connection was used in the application in order to store required informations of  created tickets by user and assigned tickets by admin. The related datas are stored in Sharepoint-List structure. Also, Flow structure was used to send email to admin when a ticket is created (with NOT STARTED status) and progressed later on.*

**=>The created interfaces can be seen at the below part on the screenshots;**
